How to Report a Potential Vulnerability?
========================================

If you would like to report a public issue (for example, one with a released
CVE number), please report it as a
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/quic-yocto/meta-qcom-hwe/issues/new).
If you have a patch ready, submit it following the same procedure as any other
patch as described in README.md.

If you are dealing with a not-yet released or urgent issue, please send a
message to one of the maintainers listed in README.md, including as many details as
possible: the layer or software module affected, the recipe and its version,
and any example code, if available.
