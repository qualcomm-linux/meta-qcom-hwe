DESCRIPTION = "QMI framework will provide sample applications to test QMI communication between Apps and other remote sub systems. It also includes multiple services to support the QMI communications. qrtr-ns service should be running in background to support QMI communication because qrtr-ns is the one which handles the qrtr control packet. qrtr-filter service is required if the target want QMI access control which avoids unprivileged access to QMI services"
